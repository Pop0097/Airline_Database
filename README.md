# Airline_Database

## What is Airline_Database

This database uses a text-based UI to simulate an airline database where customers can book or cancel tickets, and employees can manage flights and process customer requests.

This database us not hosted. Thus, the termination of the program will result in the loss of all changes made by the user.

## Inspiration

I made this database to further solidify my skills in object oriented programming in C++.

## How to deploy the program

1. Download the repository onto your computer (depending on your operating system you may need to extract the files from the zip file).
2. Open the .cpp and .h files in an IDE that can compile C++ and run the code.
3. Navigate the database in the IDE and enjoy! :))

**Note:** Default login credentials for employee accounts:
- **Username:** d_uname
- **Password:** pass

**Note:** The default flight that is created when the program is launched has the following information:
- **Flight Number:** 12345
- **Departure Date (DD/MM/YYYY):** 01/01/2021
- **Departure Location:** Ottawa, Canada (YOW)
- **Arrival Location:** Toronto, Canada (YYZ)
This information is required if you want to modify this flight (book tickets, etc.).
